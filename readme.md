How to Play
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
The player is presented with a series of underscores representing the word's length.
The player guesses letters one at a time.
If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed at its correct positions.
If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman is drawn.
The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or the hangman is complete.
